# DSC Event Management System

## 📚 About
The main task is to keep a track of the attendees of our events. Make a platform to ease the task of managing and keeping track of the participants attending the events. The database will have several events and for each event keep a track of contact details of the participants like name, email, etc. and their attendance for each slot. Events can have varying slots based on the duration of the event. On the first webpage, the admin should be able to mark the attendance of the participants according to their time slots. The second webpage will display the final table with the functionality to sort by the number of slots attended.

## 🔧 Installation
